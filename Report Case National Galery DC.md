## 5. Evidence relating to theft of valuable stamps
This sub-section provides details regarding the evidence found as it relates to the theft of valuable stamps. 

The analysis of the confiscated IPhone revealed communication between the implicated that lead to the next conclusions.

Communication between Terry and Joe revealed Tracy's financial struggle related to the tuition of her daughter's school and a recurrent conflict with Joe about the custody of Terry **(Appendix A artifact #12)**. This issue deteriorated the relationship between Tracy and her daughter. Terry seemed to favor his Dad over Tracy. **(Appendix A artifacts #28, 30, 31, 44, 45, 46, 49)**

Motivated by financial and emotional circumstances related to her daughter and ex-husband, she contacts Pat to set up an illegal business. Pat agreed to the proposal **(Appendix A artifact #1)** since he also had been facing financial hardship **(Appendix A artifact #6)**. They made arrangements to use the alias of Coral for Tracy and Perry for Pat. Likewise, they would use Virtual Machines for communications related to this matter. **(Appendix A artifacts #2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)**

After looking for a target **(Appendix A artifacts #9, 10, 11)**, Tracy found the stamps. **(Appendix A artifacts #13, 18)**. She emails Pat documents about the stamp insurance. Then, Pat contacted King. He intimidates King into joining the theft **(Appendix A artifact #16)**. King accepted the proposal and asked for specific equipment for the heist **(Appendix A artifact #21)**. Photos of the Stamps were found on the iPhone.

**Facts:**

- Tracy and Pat agreed to gain wealth through dishonest ways. **(Appendix A artifacts #1, 6)**

## 6. Evidence relating to defacement of museum art
This sub-section provides details regarding the evidence found as it relates to the defacement of museum art. 

Carry took advantage of Tracy’s financial struggle **(Appendix A artifact #14)**.  She contacts her and asks for no ethical favor, but not illegal, in exchange for financial compensation **(Appendix A artifact #19)**. Afterward, Carry escalated her inquiries for information about the security shift schedule of the gallery for financial compensation and Tracy agreed. **(Appendix A artifacts #22, 23, 24, 25)**

Tracy does not know about Carry real intentions for the defacement of the museum of art. Carry explaining a typographical error of the expression “it will be gun” for “it will be fun” in her email leads to that idea. **(Appendix A artifact #26)**

**Facts:**

- Carry contacted Tracy. She knew about her financial struggle. **(Appendix A artifact #14)**

- Tracy accepted Carry’s unethical first favor in exchange for compensation.  **(Appendix A artifacts #19, 20)**

- A typographical error can prove Tracy's unawareness of Carry's intention. **(Appendix A artifact #26)**

- Carry proposed a new unethical favor to Tracy in exchange for financial compensation. The proposal was highly unethical and suspicious, however, Tracy accepted the proposal ignoring the questionable nature of the request due to the relief the reward would give her economic situation. **(Appendix A artifacts #22, 23)**

- Carry and Tracy intended to meet. **(Appendix A artifacts #39, 43, 47, 48)**

## 8. Conclusion
Evidence found on Tracy’s iPhone indicated the following: 

The evidence confirms a conspiracy associated with the theft of valuable stamps and the relation of the individual Tracy in the defacing of the National Gallery. Both events occur simultaneously. Nevertheless, both events have different characters involved.

There are four persons identified as involved in these criminal plots:

- **Tracy**, the owner of the confiscated iPhone, is the only suspect in these 2 plots. She is one of the conceivers of the Stamp heist. Likewise, she is involved in the defacing conspiracy without being aware. Tracy works as a supervisor at the National Gallery. Her money issues were exploited by Carry. She escalates her favors to Carry from "sneaking into a flash mob" event to releasing security data. 

- **Pat** is Tracy's brother. He gets involved in the theft conspiracy by contacting and blackmailing King, the robber.

- **King** is the person who physically would execute the theft of the stamp.

The other two characters are not involved:

- **Terry** is Tracy's daughter. Terry's tuition is the reason for Tracy's money struggle.
