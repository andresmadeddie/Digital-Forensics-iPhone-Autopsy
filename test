There is explicit information in the data obtained from the SMS, Mails, and records from the IPhone that leads to these details. Mail communications between King, Tracy, and Pat show Pat proposing and blackmailing King to involve him in the theft, to King requiring tools for the robbery, and communication between Pat and Tracy about the stamps.

Evidence relating to theft of valuable stamps
This sub-section provides details regarding the evidence found as it relates to the theft of valuable stamps. 

The analysis of the confiscated IPhone revealed communication between the implicated that lead to the next conclusions.

Tracy, Pat, and King are involved in the conspiracy of the stamps’s theft 
Tracy and Pat are the conceivers of this heist. They have financial Motivations.
King's motivations involve blackmailing from Pat.

Communication between Terry and Joe revealed Tracy’s financial struggle related to the tuition of her daughter’s school, and a current conflict with Joe about the custody of Terry (Appendix A artifax 12). This issue impacts the relation of Tracy with her daughter  where Terry seems to favor his Dad over Tracy.  (Appendix A artifax 28, 30, 31, 44, 45, 46, and  49).

With this motivation, she contacts Pat to set up an illegal business. Pat agreed to the proposal (Appendix A artifax 1) since he had been facing financial hardships  (Appendix A artifax 6). They made arrangements including the use of aliases Coral (Tracy) and Perry (Pat). Likewise, they would use Virtual Machines for communications related to this matter. (Appendix A artifax 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)

After looking for a target(Appendix A artifax 9, 10, 11), Tracy found the stamps (Appendix A artifax 13, 18). Then, Pat contacted King. He threatened him at the same time he proposed the heist (Appendix A artifax 16). King accepted the proposal and asked for specific equipment for the heist (Appendix A artifax 21). Photos of the Stamps were found in the IPhone.


Evidence relating to defacement of museum art
This sub-section provides details regarding the evidence found as it relates to the defacement of museum art. 

The analysis of the confiscated IPhone revealed communication between the implicated that lead to the next conclusions.

Carry is the conceiver of the defacement conspiracy against the Gallery
Tracy does not know about Carry real intentions
Tracy gets involved in this conspiracy without knowing about it.

Carry took advantage of Tracy’s financial struggle(Appendix A artifax 14).  She contacts her and asks for no ethical favor, but not illegal, in exchange for financial compensation (Appendix A artifax 19). Afterward, Carry escalated her inquiries for information about the security shift schedule of the gallery for financial compensation and Tracy agreed.(Appendix A artifax 22, 23, 24, 25).

Tracy does not know about Carry real intentions for the defacement of the museum of art. Carry explaining a typographical  error of the expression “it will be gun” for “it will be fun” in her email leads to that idea.(Appendix A artifax 26)
